# Incident Investigation - Suspicious Scheduled Task Persistence

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to simulate an attacker persistence technique
and perform a SOC-style incident investigation using Windows Security logs.

This investigation demonstrates how suspicious scheduled tasks can be
identified and analyzed during incident response activities.

## Environment

Target System:
- SRV01

Domain:
- SOC.local

User Account:
- SOC\johjoh

Log Source:
- Windows Security Event Logs

## Environment Validation

Initial validation of the system and user context was performed before
starting the incident simulation.

## Evidence

System and user context verification.
